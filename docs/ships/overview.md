### Small Ships

|Ship||Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|![](../assets/icons/eagle-mk-ii.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Eagle Mk. 2](./eagle2.md) | Very agile but also squishy and limited offense. Only slightly cheaper than the Viper Mk. 3 |
|![](../assets/icons/diamondback-scout.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Diamondback Scout](./diamondbackscout.md) | Similar in stats to the Viper Mk. 3, just more expensive. |
|![](../assets/icons/viper-mk-iv.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Viper Mk. 4](./viper4.md) | Slower and tankier, more difficult to fly. |
|![](../assets/icons/imperial-courier.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Imperial Courier](./courier.md) | Can be engineered to be quite fast and have great shields. Requires Rank with the Empire. |

### Medium Ships

|Ship||Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|![](../assets/icons/fer-de-lance.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Fer-de-Lance](./ferdelance.md)|High skill floor and ceiling flight model, great hardpoints and very strong shields|
|![](../assets/icons/alliance-challenger.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Alliance Challenger](./challenger.md) |Very tanky and great offense.|
|![](../assets/icons/alliance-crusader.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline:  Alliance Crusader](./crusader.md) |Slightly slower and less tanky than the Chieftain, but can equip a fighter hangar.|
|![](../assets/icons/mamba.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|:wip: Mamba |Fast in a straight line, but less agile in other aspects. Very good shields, many big hardpoints with bad convergence.|
|![](../assets/icons/krait-mk-ii.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|:wip: Krait Mk. II|A very easy to learn but low potential flight model, however great offensive options, decent defense and the option to carry a fighter hangar.|
|![](../assets/icons/krait-phantom.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|:wip: Krait Phantom|Fast lightweight ship (similar flight model to the Krait Mk. 2) with great offensive and decent defensive options.|
|![](../assets/icons/python.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Python](./python.md)|Not as easy to fly and slower, but tankier.|

### Large Ships

|Ship||Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|![](../assets/icons/federal-corvette.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Federal Corvette](./corvette.md)|The unique set of two huge hardpoints offers some fun options, however the positioning of the remaining hardpoints is a bit lackluster. Easiest to handle out of this category. Requires Rank with the Federation.|
|![](../assets/icons/imperial-cutter.svg){.image100 loading=lazy}|[:material-information-outline: Imperial Cutter](./cutter.md)|Great hardpoint grouping (for the most part), incredible tank and the option to mount a massive bi-weave. However the lack of turnrate and lateral/vertical thrust makes it tiresome to handle. Requires Rank with the Empire.|

## Remarks
All Builds are provided with one of three game progression stages in mind:

- :material-hexagon: **Basic**: No use of engineering or broker modules
- :material-hexagon-multiple: **Full Engineering**: Use of all relevant engineers and in some instances Guardian Shield Reinforcements

Prices are listed without discounts. Keep in mind that any ship hull and module bought in **systems controlled or exploited by Li Yong-Rui are discounted by 15%**, or 17.1% if the player has at least one elite rank. Setting EDDBs power field is sufficient to guarantee it showing such results only.

Some builds require **disabling cargo hatch (and AFMU) via power priorities**, due to a restrictive powerplant!

In Coriolis, use the **$** symbol (top right) to open a link to EDDB with all modules filled in. In EDSY this function is in the same area, hidden behind the **OPS** button.

Weapon loadouts are often down to preference, experiment with them!

The larger ships especially have plenty of optionals which can be used for utility (GFSD Booster etc.) instead of armor as present in the example builds.
