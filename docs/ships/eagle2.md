Hardpoint Configuration: [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/?s=eagle){target=_blank, .bulletinLink}

Cheaper fully kitted out than the [:material-information-outline: Viper Mk III](./viper3.md), and:

* slightly more agile
* significantly less survivability
* weak offense

Unengineered builds are forced into hulltanking.
