# Anaconda
![Ship Image](../assets/icons/anaconda.svg){.image250}

Hardpoint Configuration: [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/?s=anaconda){target=_blank, .bulletinLink}

The ultimate PvE bastion:

* Sufficiently tanky
* Decently agile (comparable to Federal Corvette, significantly better than T10 or Imperial Cutter)
* Very good hardpoint quantity and convergence with the biggest distributor available

Should be built as a shield tank, regardless of access to engineering.

## Exotic Builds

These builds are not considered optimal, but instead focus on a specific concept for fun:

[:material-link: Can you tell I like railguns?](https://edsy.org/#/L=H600000H4C0SC0,KZyG09M_W0KZyG09M_W0KZyG09M_W0KZyG09M_W0KZyG09M_W0KZyG09M_W0KYiG07M_W0KYiG07M_W0,DCYG09L_W0DCYG09L_W0DCYG09L_W0DCYG0BL_W0DBwG05L_W0DBwG05L_W0DBwG05L_W0DBwG05L_W0,9p3G05I_W0ADIG03I_W0ARMG05I_W0AfQG05J_W0Aty00BBoG03L_W0BRuG05G_W0Bcg00,16yG05I_W0,7WCG07I_W07k4G054_W07k4G054_W07k4O054_W016yG05I_W016yG05I_W025S0023u0015OG05I_W015OG05I_W012GG05I_W010iG05I_W0,Only_0Rails){target=_blank, .bulletinLink} Requires very good pip management to avoid overheating and very good range management to maximize effectiveness of primary armament. Very satisfying.
