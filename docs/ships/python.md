Hardpoint Configuration: [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/?s=python){target=_blank, .bulletinLink}

A very strong medium ship. Much more expensive than the recommended *Alliance Chieftain*, so instead it should be compared against its more closely priced competitors such as [:material-information-outline: Krait Mk II](./krait2.md):

* Very tanky (easily the tankiest medium)
* Equally good offensive capabilities
* Slower and more difficult to fly

Notes:

* Fitting an A-rated shield gen just barely allows this build to effectively use shield cell banks, dramatically increasing survivability
* Keep the class 5 SCBs turned off so the class 6s get used up first. Use heatsinks as necessary, until running out. Some heat damage is expected. Be sure to turn class 5s back on once the class 6s run out.
