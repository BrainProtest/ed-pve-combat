![Ship Image](../assets/icons/imperial-courier.svg){.image250}

Hardpoint Configuration: [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/?s=imperial-courier){target=_blank, .bulletinLink}

Significantly more expensive than the [:material-information-outline: Viper Mk III](./viper3.md) and requiring rank with the Empire to unlock. Not quite on the same level as the more expensive [:material-information-outline: Vulture](./vulture.md).

* Very good shields
* Fast
* Offensive comparable to a Viper Mk III

Can be built as a shield tank even unengineered.
