# Viper Mk. III
![Ship Image](../assets/icons/viper-mk-iii.svg){.image250}

Hardpoint Configuration: [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/?s=viper-mk-iii){target=_blank, .bulletinLink}

The cheapest effective ship for PvE, thanks to:

* Good agility with a rewarding flight model
* Decent survivability
* Fine offensive capability with well positioned hardpoints

Forced to be run as a hulltank: A small shield with the intent of soaking up damage, eventually going down and thanks to a short rebuild time regain it without taking too much damage on the tanky hull beneath.

## :material-hexagon: Basic Build **2.56M Cr**

Notes:

* If you're overwhelmed at first you can swap the fixed pulse lasers for the gimballed variant, so you can focus more on flying. Be sure to switch back to fixed once you're overall more comfortable.
