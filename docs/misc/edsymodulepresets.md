# E:D Shipyard Module Presets
## What are Module Presets?

Module presets in EDSY allow you to add an engineered module into a slot of your build with just one click. The presets provided here aim to make building ships in EDSY quicker by providing the most commonly used engineering combinations, without cluttering the module list by adding excessive amount of presets.
