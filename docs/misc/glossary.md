* **Alpha**: Per round/shot damage
* **Convergence**: The separation of hardpoints between each other. Using fixed ToT: Time On Target. The ability of the player or the requirement of a weapon to aim at a target continuously. Weaponry on far apart hardpoints will make it hard or impossible to hit all at the same time.
* **Distributor**: Refers to the Power Distributor Module found in the Core Internals of every ship

* **Hitscan**: Infinite Projectile speed (where you aim is where you hit, no delay)
* **Hotbanking**: Using a shield cell without a heatsink. If heat damage occurs, it is expected.
* **RoF**: Rate of Fire, if a value is given assume rounds / second.
* **Sustained Damage Per Second**: A refined metric for measuring the damage potential of a weapon, is it also factors reload and charge times. Can also take energy delivery based on the power distributor into account.
* **SCB**: Shield Cell Bank
* **ToT**: Time on Target: The proportion of time one can spend firing a weapon compared to time needed to reposition. Some weapons rely on having high ToT to be effective.
