## Installing the Controls Preset

### 1. Navigate to the Bindings Folder

Navigate here:

```
%localappdata%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings
```

Copy your controls preset file, and start up the game. Start any macro files as required.

### 2. Select the Preset in the Game

Now in the **Options :material-arrow-right: Controls** menu, open the General, Ship, SRV & On-Foot control menus one by one. Select the binds you downloaded in the preset dropdown top right.
    
### Notes

* Installing the controls file does not overwrite any existing controls
* You can change individual bindings as you would do with any normal binding preset. Changes are however saved directly to the .binds file rather than a generic 'Custom' binds file.
* You can also rename the preset by opening the file in a text editor and changing the property `PresetName` and renaming the file itself to `<YourNameHere>.4.1.binds`. Make sure the name of the file is the same as the preset name, otherwise you will encounter issues saving your preset.
* The preset differs greatly from the standard layout (in good ways only, tho)


## Control Layout Diagram

## Explanations

* The binds on the numpad are intended for supercruise.
* What is wrong with the Standard Presets?
    * Pip Management is on the arrow keys, and with how important it is for efficient use of ship capabilities and resources, this is way out of reach in normal use.
    * Little emphasis is put on lateral and vertical thrusters, despite these being really important for efficient maneuvering
