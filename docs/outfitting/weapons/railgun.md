# Railgun

67% Thermal, 33% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Railguns offer extreme damage output at high distributor draw and heat generation. Their damage falloff starts at 1000m, but since they are a high alpha, low RoF hitscan weapon it should be easy to keep them in effective range. Only exists in small and medium size (however installing on larger hardpoints is very much viable). All sizes have a Piercing value of 100. The total damage per ammo pool is subpar to other weapons of similar size.

On ships with a sufficiently large fuel tank, running the plasma slug experimental allows spamming rail guns. They are a very good alternative to lasers with better distributor efficiency and better damage at the same size.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Long Range|Increases maximum range and removes damage falloff completely|
|:material-star: Short Range|Massive boost in damage output, but limits range significantly|

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|Feedback Cascade|Scales with damage dealt. Hitting an enemies shield while their shield cell is charging reduces that shield cells reinforcement by up to 90%|
|Superpenetrator|Allows the weapon to hit multiple internal modules on breach|
|Plasma Slug|Instead of an ammo pool, the weapon reloads 0.022t of fuel per projectile from the ships forward fuel tank|
