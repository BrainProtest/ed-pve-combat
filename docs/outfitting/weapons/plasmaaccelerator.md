# Plasma Accelerator

60% Absolute, 20% Thermal, 20% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Plasma Accelerators offer great damage output with high distributor draw and thermal load. The projectiles feature low projectile speed. Their overall stats mean they are not considered viable when unengineered, but extremely potent when engineered.

Builds focused on Plasma Accelerators may lean towards high sustainability via the Plasma Slug experimental. Alternatively, focusing on pure damage output with a Thermal Conduit build is an option. On such a build, running an Overcharged G5 powerplant and potentially also including a single Short Range Plasma Accelerator can help gain and maintain heat in the optimal range of 100% - 150% (high enough to get some damage bonus, but low enough that most modules will survive until ammunition runs out).

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Efficient|Removes thermal and distributor problems|
|Short Range|Increased damage output. Increased thermal load, decreased max range.|

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Dispersal Field|Disrupts gimballed and turreted weapons on the receiving ship|
|:material-star: Thermal Conduit|Damage buff scaling linearly from 90% heat to 150% heat topping out at +60% damage|
|:material-star: Plasma Slug|Instead of an ammo pool, the weapon reloads 0.022t of fuel per projectile from the ships forward fuel tank|
|Oversized|Slightly increases Damage|
