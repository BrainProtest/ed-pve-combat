# Multicannon

100% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Mullticannons offer great damage output at very little distributor draw. Further their projectiles have a high shotspeed and a favorable falloff start at 2000m. They depend on high ToT to be effective. Multicannons have great total damage per ammo pool. Bigger classes become increasingly more ammo efficient.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|Overcharged|Increase damage output. Slight increase in thermal load, Slight increase in distributor draw. Reduced ammo clip size. |
|Short Range|Increased damage output. Increased thermal load, decreased max range. |

Both of these mods increase the effective total damage per ammo pool significantly.

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Incendiary|Changes damage type to 90% Thermal, 10% Kinetic|
|:material-star: Corrosive|Does not stack. Buffs the piercing value of *all projectiles* (regardless of origin) hitting the target ship by 20 points, and all incoming damage by a further 25%|
|Oversized|Increases Damage|
|Auto Loader|Will slowly reload magazine one by one from ammo pool|
|Emissive|Duration scales with damage, does not stack. Prevents loss of target lock if target heat is low|
