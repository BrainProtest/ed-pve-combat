# Multicannon

100% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Mullticannons offer great damage output at very little distributor draw. Further their projectiles have a high shotspeed and a favorable falloff start at 2000m. They depend on high ToT to be effective. Multicannons have great total damage per ammo pool. Bigger classes become increasingly more ammo efficient.

Building with a full focus on just Multicannons is viable thanks to the Incendiary experimental offering a much more favorable thermal damage type. Fully fixed weapon loadouts are viable and fun to use, but may struggle fighting small ships. Adding some utility hitscan weaponry such as Rail Guns is always recommended for a consistent long range damage option.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|Overcharged|Increase damage output. Slight increase in thermal load, Slight increase in distributor draw. Reduced ammo clip size. |
|Short Range|Increased damage output. Increased thermal load, decreased max range. |

Both of these mods increase the effective total damage per ammo pool significantly.

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Incendiary|Changes damage type to 90% Thermal, 10% Kinetic|
|:material-star: Corrosive|Does not stack. Buffs the piercing value of *all projectiles* (regardless of origin) hitting the target ship by 20 points, and all incoming damage by a further 25%|
|Auto Loader|Will slowly reload magazine one by one from ammo pool|
|Emissive|Duration scales with damage, does not stack. Prevents loss of target lock if target heat is low|
|Oversized|Slightly increases Damage|
