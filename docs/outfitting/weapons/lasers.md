# Laser (Pulse, Burst, Beam)

100% Thermal
{.hint}

## Function

Lasers in general have low damage per unit of distributor energy consumed (Damage Per Energy). Pulse and Burst are significantly more efficient than the Beam at the cost of potential peak damage output. Pulse and Burst have a damage falloff start at 500m, Beam at 600m. This is exceptionally short, and forms one of the major drawbacks of laser weaponry, because lasers depend on high ToT, subsequently requiring good range management for efficiency.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Long Range|Increases maximum range and removes damage falloff completely|
|:material-star: Efficient|Removes thermal and distributor problems|

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Available On|Effect|
|-|-|-|
|:material-star: Emissive|Pulse|Duration scales with damage, does not stack. Prevents loss of target lock if target heat is low|
|Oversized|All|Increases Damage|
|Thermal Vent|Beam|Thermal load stat of the weapon is inverted if the weapon hits a ship|
|Thermal Conduit|Beam|Linear damage buff scaling from 90% heat to 150% heat topping out at +60% damage|
|Phasing|Pulse, Burst|The 10% of default damage lost is applied through shields directly to the hull, in form of absolute damage|
