# Fragment Cannon

100% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Fragment Cannons offer extreme damage output at very little distributor draw. The nature of their shotgun-like spread means that they are only effective at extremely close ranges (~200m and closer, depending on the target size). Due to having a long reload, small magazine and high rate of fire they are regarded as a high alpha weapon. A huge variant of these does not exist. In theory, they have very great total damage per ammo pool. However, it is very easy to waste shots, and they can go through their ammo pool very quickly, which may make it appear otherwise.

The **Pacifier** powerplay weapon (class 3 fixed) outclasses all other frag cannons by having a much tighter projectile spread, making it much more consistent as a weapon.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Overcharged|Increase damage output and ammo pool size|
|:material-star: High Capacity|Better total damage and better sustained DPS (full ToT), longer burst duration and more power draw|

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Incendiary|Changes damage type to 90% Thermal, 10% Kinetic|
|:material-star: Drag Munitions|Slows down target|
|:material-star: Corrosive|Does not stack. Buffs the piercing value of *all projectiles* (regardless of origin) hitting the target ship by 20 points, and all incoming damage by a further 25%|
|Screening Shell|Cuts the reload in half, +85% sustained ROF|
