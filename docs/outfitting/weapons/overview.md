# Weapons

## General Considerations

- Keep damage types and their advantages & disadvantages in mind! Refer to [:material-information-outline: Tactics/Damage](../../tactics/damage.md).
- If mixing thermal and kinetic weaponry, the latter should be put on the larger hardpoints and the former on the smaller. Smaller weapons get a debuff against bigger enemy ships.
- A balance has to be found between DPS output and ammo dependency. High DPS weapons usually don't have much ammo.
- The weapon loadout should be designed with the distributor in mind. If your weapon loadout can just about be sustained indefinitely on 4 pips then it's easy to run without throwing away potential. Once you can only support 75% of your weaponry at 4pips indefinitely you might wanna reduce the distro draw.

## Weapon Mounting 

For all weapons, the preferred mounting type is Fixed. Upgrading from a gimballed weapon to a fixed one comes at a bonus of ~ 20% to ~ 50% more damage output, a reduction of ~ 7% distributor draw and additional ~ 40% to ~ 80% total damage per ammo pool, amongst other minor stat differences. Exact numbers vary across weapon sizes and types. Further, fixed weaponry is immune to chaff and has a micro gimbal effect which snaps to target modules within a few pixels.

Fixed mounting can be unviable, this could be lack of pilot skill (that being said, only way to learn fixed is to use it), bad hardpoint [convergence](../../misc/glossary.md#convergence), or mixing weapons of different shotspeeds.

Turrets should be avoided. They have bad damage output and slow tracking (so slow that in reality they often end up with less ToT than a gimballed counterpart, assuming any piloting at all is done). All ships in the game handle well enough to subsequently perform better with gimballed and/or fixed.

### Identifying Hardpoint Groups

When fitting fixed weaponry with the goal of firing multiple weapons at once, hardpoint [convergence](../../misc/glossary.md#convergence){.glossaryLink} becomes very important. Use [:material-link: E:D Ship Anatomy](https://siriuscorp.cc/edsa/) to identify such groups. Also keep the above considerations in mind.

## Good Weapon Combinations
### Unengineered

No-brainer:

- Smaller fixed **Pulse/Burst** + larger gimballed **Multicannon**
- Smaller fixed **Pulse/Burst** + larger gimballed **Fragment Cannon**
- Smaller fixed **Pulse/Burst** + larger fixed **Cannon**

Hot and/or heavy on the distributor:

- **Railgun** + gimballed/fixed **Multicannon**
- **Railgun** + gimballed **Fragment Cannon** (and Pacifier)
- **Railgun** + fixed **Cannon**
- **Plasma Accelerator** + gimballed/fixed **Multicannon**
- **Plasma Accelerator** + gimballed **Fragment Cannon** (and Pacifier)
- **Plasma Accelerator** + fixed **Cannon**
- Any thermal or absolute damage weapon alone

### Engineered

- Any of the above, with the recommended mods
- **Multicannons only**, partially or fully with **Incendiary** experimental for thermal damage and one **Corrosive**
- Long or short range plasma slug **Railguns** + efficient plasma slug **Plasma Accelerators** (May require additional Fuel Tanks!)
- A mix of short and long range plasma slug **Railguns** (Former for damage, latter for use at range. May require additional Fuel Tanks!)

## Other Weapons

- **Guardian** and **Anti Xeno** Weaponry: Ineffective against human ships
- **Shock Cannons**: Very fun, but canâ€™t be engineered and very small ammo pool
- **Mines, Torps**: Useless in PvE
- **Seekers/Dumbfires**: Lack ammo pool to be good
