# Cannon

100% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Cannons offer great damage output at very little distributor draw. However, their projectiles have low speed, and the projectile velocity is not the same across all sizes. They have effectively no damage drop off. As a high alpha, low RoF weapon they do not depend on ToT to be effective. Cannons have unfavorable total damage per ammo pool. For a given size, a fixed Cannon will have a similar total damage as a gimballed Multicannon.

For this weapon type the gimballed variant is especially bad and should be avoided. Cannons are a good choice as a kinetic primary damage dealer, but should be paired with other high alpha thermal damage dealers, such as Rail Guns.

## Engineering
### Modifications

|Modification|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Overcharged|Increase damage output and ammo pool size|

### Experimentals

|Experimental|Effect|
|-|-|
|:material-star: Dispersal Field|Disrupts gimballed and turreted weapons on the receiving ship|
|Auto Loader|Will slowly reload magazine one by one from ammo pool|
|Force Shell|Imparts an impulse to the target on hit, pushing it along the projectiles direction of travel. Funny, but usually not really helpful|
|High Yield Shell|Half of the damage is now of explosive damage type, applied in an explosion sphere. Reduces overall damage significantly.|
|Oversized|Slightly increases Damage|
