# Cannon

100% Kinetic
{.hint}

## Function

Cannons offer great damage output at very little distributor draw. However, their projectiles have low speed, and the projectile velocity is not the same across all sizes. They have effectively no damage drop off. As a high alpha, low RoF weapon they do not depend on ToT to be effective. Cannons have unfavorable total damage per ammo pool. For a given size, a fixed Cannon will have a similar total damage as a gimballed Multicannon.

For this weapon type the gimballed variant is especially bad and should be avoided.
