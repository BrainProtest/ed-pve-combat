# Utility Mounts

## Shield Booster

Provide increased shield health relative to the ships initial shield health (relative to the shield amount of the shield generator only, before any shield boosters or guardian shield reinforcement packages). Since the bonus is relative, this module is significantly more effective on ships with good shields to begin with.

Engineering:

* **Resistance Augmented** + **Super Capacitors**: Increases the shields resistances
    * Significant increase in power draw
    * The main benefit here is the resistance, so choosing E-rating is viable here to reduce power requirements
* **Heavy Duty** + **Super Capacitors**: Increases the shield boost multiplier
* Thermal Resistant + Super Capacitors: Significantly increases just thermal resistance, sometimes used to correct for weak base resistances

## Chaff Launcher

Comes with 11 charges, each of which will disrupt enemy gimballed and turreted weaponry for 15 seconds. Useful mostly on smaller ships when under a lot of pressure. Engineering: **Ammo Capacity**

## Heat Sink Launcher

Comes with 3 charges, each of which will soak up heat from the ship until expired, and simultaneously boost `[WEP]` capacitor recharge rate. Engineering: **Ammo Capacity**

## Point Defence

Fires at explosives such as mines, dumb fire and seeker missiles. Requires line of sight, and is quickly overwhelmed at shorter distances or with multiple incoming projectiles.

## Electronic Countermeasure

Can be charged up to instantly destroy enemy explosives within a certain range, but a long cooldown makes it ineffective at dealing with continuous attack.

## Kill Warrant Scanner

May reveal additional bounties on NPCs when scanned. Takes a lot of power, use lesser grades only. Utility mounts are valuable and usually in short supply, so the KWS is not generally recommended across the board.
