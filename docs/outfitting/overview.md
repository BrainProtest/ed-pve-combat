# Outfitting

## Notes

Only upgrade to a new ships when you can also afford modules, not just the bare hull. Ships without upgraded modules are with no exception bad, and will most likely represent a downgrade from a smaller, cheaper but fully upgraded ship.

On combat ships, you should only carry modules directly beneficial to the ships combat effectiveness under normal circumstances. Leave that docking computer at home.

PvE combat ships are not built for and will fail miserably if subject to other specialized forms of combat, such as AX PvE combat or PvP, as they are built to receive different damage types and are also optimized for sustainability.

The build process as described is aimed at usage with sites such as [:material-link: E:D Shipyard](https://edsy.org). The ingame outfitting menu is no fit for this task!

Where engineering is mentioned, apply the highest grade you have access to (unless otherwise specified), or ignore completely if you have no access to it.

## Build Design: Step by Step

### 1. Prepare Core Internals

- **Power Plant**: Biggest A-rated. Engineering: Armored + Thermal Spread
- **Thrusters**: Biggest A-rated. Engineering: Dirty Drives + Drag Drives
- **Frame Shift Drive**: Biggest A-rated. Engineering: Increased Range + Mass Manager
- **Life Support**: D-rated
- **Power Distributor**: Biggest A-rated. Engineering: Charge Enhanced + Super Conduits
- **Sensors**: D-rated. Engineering Lightweight or Long Range

Clear all default modules from the Optional Internals and Hardpoints

### 2. [:material-information-outline: Defense Strategy](defense.md)

### 3. [:material-information-outline: Weapons](./weapons/overview.md)

### 4. Finalise and Balance

- Check if power requirements are met. If not, select the lowest grade of Overcharged + Thermal Spread fitting, and/or redo modifications and experimentals on shield boosters, shield cell banks, etc. to reduce power draw.
- Set up Power Priorities
