# Beginners

If you fly with Keyboard and Mouse, don’t use the default layout, as it underrepresents pip management and lateral/vertical thrust. See the [:material-information-outline: Improved Preset for Mouse & Keyboard](../misc/controls.md)
{.hint}

Even right out the gate you can get into combat and have a lot of fun. Here's a little checklist of what you should get ready first

- a decent ship
    - At minimum a slightly upgraded sidewinder (better thrusters, better power distributor, hull reinforcements in the optional slots). 
    - Ideally a ship recommended in this guide (see [:material-information-outline: shipbuilds overview page](../ships/overview.md))
- Multiple rebuys for margin of error (compare balance and rebuy cost in the right hand panel, home tab, bottom left)

A great place for an introduction to combat is POIs called *Resource Extraction Site (High)* (shorted to *HighRES*). You can find them near ringed planets in populated starsystems:

- Locate security forces. The names will be obvious and once you gain some reputation locally their icons will display green.
- Follow the security ships around. Have them do the heavy lifting, while you pick up the bounty.
- Scan all ships near you when you have the time, so you know in advance who is wanted and who isn't.
- When a wanted ship is being attacked by security forces, join in. Make sure not to do too much damage at first (so the enemies attention doesn't switch to you)
- When you're done, find a station within the system, dock and open contacts -> authority menu to cash in your bounties

This will get you quite a lot of cash easily and quickly while also teaching you about the various ships there are and introduces you to the way NPCs fly.

It is recommended to visit , found in planetary rings in almost all populated systems. Here you can follow the local security forces (commonly called “System Authority Vessel”, “Federal Security Service”, etc), as they will quickly dispatch of any pirate vessels they find. All you need to do is tag whatever they are shooting, and you will get the full bounty payout. Be sure to do less damage than the most prominent single security ship, to avoid the pirate switching it’s focus to you. Be sure to not damage clean ships. At the start it is recommended to always finish scanning and making sure the target is wanted before you initiate fire.

Doing this will give you a feel for what to expect, given the ship type and combat rank of an NPC. The overall ranking is applicable across all areas of PvE combat.

Once you're more confident in your ability to control your ship, start picking your own fights

Just going after pirates without immediate system security backup in a HighRES is a good start, or accepting pirate assassination missions (stay away from assassination missions targeting civilians, or those designed to be completed in a full wing, marked by the blue wing icon)
