# Damage

Weapon types will deal thermal, kinetic, explosive or absolute damage (or a mix thereof). This guide recommends primarily the following weapons

- **Unengineered Multicannons**: 100% kinetic
- **Lasers**: 100% thermal
- **Engineered Multicannons** with **Incendiary** Secondary: 90% thermal, 10% kinetic
- **Railguns**: 67% thermal, 33% kinetic

In PvE the vast majority of ships you face will have (close to) **default resistances**:

|Healthpool|Thermal|Kinetic|Explosive|Absolute|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Shield|- 20% {.text-positive}|40% {.text-negative}|50% {.text-negative}|0% {.text-positive}|
|Hull|0% {.text-positive}|-20% {.text-positive}|- 40% {.text-positive}|0% {.text-positive}|

As is readily apparent kinetic and explosive weaponry is resisted well by shields. On the other hand hull is weak against all damage types, but kinetic and explosive gain a bonus. This results in some considerations:

- You should avoid firing weapons of kinetic damage type at the enemies shield. Once the opponent looses their shield you should however open up with your entire armament (distributor allowing).
- Having thermal weaponry is preferred and full thermal weapon loadouts are viable (As opposed to full kinetic or full explosive).
