# Positioning

This topic meshes closely with pip management. Read up on primary and secondary effects of pips and capacitor levels in the [:material-information-outline: Pip Management](./pips.md) section.

## Start the engagement

Always begin the engagement in a position favoring you. For this position yourself slightly above/below and behind the enemy ship. This will make them a big target while also denying the ability to immediately fire back.

## Exploit a favorable position

When you are behind an enemy they will not be able to shoot back while you have free fire. This means you do not have to shift pips to mitigate damage, so should use all 6 pips at your disposal for engines and weapons. Use lateral and vertical thrusters to maintain your position behind the opponent. Keep your speed near to the blue zone to maximize your lateral and vertical thrust. If the enemy ship boosts, initiate one yourself in order to keep up. If necessary, handbrake your boost (with a temporary deployment of cargo scoop or landing gear) so you don't overshoot.

Should the opponent succeed in breaking out of this position, reestablish it:

## Reestablish a favorable position

To start out with, face the opponent and tank them. Have four pips in SYS to reduce damage to your shield by 60%, and use the remaining two pips for ENG or WEP (whichever needs it more at the time). Fly towards your opponent at full speed. Fire weapons if your situation allows it. Your goal is to pass relatively close to your opponent.

Now shortly before you pass the enemy, initiate a boost. Ideally you'll time it just right so the boost kicks in as you are right next to the opponent. Now use full pitch and yaw input to turn on the spot. Use vertical thrust first in the original direction adn switch halfway to the turn to the opposite direction to achieve this effect. If necessary, temporarily deploy cargo hatch or landing gear to handbrake your boost.

If done well, this maneouver will put you right behind the opponents rear, flying at roughly the same speed in roughly the same direction. Exploit this position.
