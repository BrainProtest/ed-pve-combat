# Disabling Flight Assist

The ships flight assist system will continously attempt to match your flight vector to the direction you are looking to. This system also cancels any rotational input once the user recenters their input device. This system can be toggled on and off at will. Disabling it changes the game completely to a full six directions of freedom. This is more demanding for inexperienced pilots, but learning to control it comes with great advantages. No flight assist means completely decoupled rotational and directional control, allowing for significantly more efficient maneouvering.

## Input Devices

In general you will need unobstructed access to forward/reverse, strafe left/right, strafe up/down, pitch, yaw and roll input.

With **Mouse & Keyboard** make sure to switch your mouse axis mode to *Relative*. This means that the virtual joystick you move with your mouse automatically recenters (as a physical stick would do).

With **Controllers and Joysticks** research how to set up axis curves. These should make your analog input more sensitive near the center so you have an easier time accurately countering your inputs.

## Learning FA-Off

You should use a ship with decent lateral and vertical thrusters (so avoid Cutter, Clipper, Assault Ship)

1. Begin by touching **directional thrust only** (forward/reverse, lateral, vertical). Use these thrusters only to maneouver through an asteroid field. This will give you a feel for how to counter your own thrust inputs. The asteroids yield ideal visual reference for determining your own velocity vector.
1. Now switch it up by touching **rotational input only**. Start with just one axis each, learn to initiate a turn and stop it again. With just one axis aim at a specific direction. Repeat with all axis and then with multiple at once.
1. **Combine directional and rotational inputs**. In the beginning be sure to only turn slowly (fast spins are hard to counter out at the beginning)
1. **Practice your FA-off flight** outside of combat. Flying around stations, asteroid fields and installations works well for this stage. Land with full FA-Off, at an outpost first, then upgrading to a rotating station.
1. Now begin **using the boost**. Practice in the same locations as listed above.
1. Now **get into combat**. The rest should come with time.
