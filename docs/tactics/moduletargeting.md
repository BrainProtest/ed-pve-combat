# Module Targeting

Once an opponent looses their shields, you can begin damaging their modules. All weapons except missiles are capable of damaging internal modules. For this to happen the projectile needs to pass a breach roll and reach far enough into the ship. The breach roll chance increases with decreasing ship integrity of the opponent ship. The weapon stats determine the minimum and maximum breach chance. Against higher hitpoint enemies it can be quite worthwhile to target and destroy some modules:

|Module|Effect of Destruction|
|-|-|
|Power Plant|Once destroyed the NPC will not be able to rebuild shield. Continued damage to a destroyed powerplant may cause a spontaneous destruction of the ship.|
|Frame Shift Drive|Destroying this module prevents the NPC from jumping away|
|Shield Generator|Destroying this module prevents rebuilding of the shield|
|Thrusters|The NPC will lose control of their ship with disabled thrusters. Useful to prevent escape|
